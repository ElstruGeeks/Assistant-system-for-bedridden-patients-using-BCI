## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Every bedridden patients in the community expectialy the group of  disebled individuals like  paralysed patients need help of other in on way or other.Sometimes even the relatives fail to reach out to emergency need of the patients.Our system is to solve some of the problems faced by the bed ridden patients.

We uses brain computer interface to develop an assistance for the patients.

This system helps the patient to control his bed and control the electrical appliances in the room and calls for help  using eye blink or attention level.
